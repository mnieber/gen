# TODO:
# - only keep tailwindconfig if using tailwind
# - based on which react modules are used, merge foo.package.json into package.json
# - keep .prettierrc if using prettier
# - report the fact that prettier is not used (for discoverability)
# - keep uikit.scss if using uikit
# - keep app, utils and framemodule if there is a react-app (which means: always keep them)
# - keep auth if using graphql-auth
# - keep forms if using the forms module.
# - keep routes if using a router
